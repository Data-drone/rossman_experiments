# Experiments in Machine Learning

This is a folder of experiments using the Kaggle Rossman Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales

I wanted to explore standard ML libraries like xgboost versus LSTM neural networks and other more esoteric methodologies.
As well as develop more methodical approaches to doing data science.

folder structure is:

root 
- data (put data here)
- feat_table
- model
- submission
     
all the notebooks and python scripts sit in the root folder
